## Linux
sudo apt-get install socat

# MacOS
brew install socat

# "SOcket CAT" can establish two bidirectional byte streams and transfer data between them.
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

# -d     : flags that enable debug output 
# pty    : creates a pseudo-terminal, which is like a virtual serial port.
# raw    : tells socat to pass the data as-is, without any additional processing (i.e., no line buffering or special character interpretation)
# echo=0 : disables echoing of input characters back to the output. Normally, terminals echo what you type, but with echo=0, input is not shown.
